# This module is a RPC remote API. It contains Manager RPC
# functions identifiers. They are used for Remote Procedure Calls
# from any other processes. See Connection.Command type for details.
# It'salso important, that this module should contain only native
# Julia definition. It shouldn't contain other modules.
