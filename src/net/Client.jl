#
# TCP Client implementation. It works in pair with Server
# module. It also works in asynchronous way (like a server)
# and implements simple RPC-like logic. All you need to do is
# create a client, add listeners to EVENT_AFTER_REQUEST event if needed
# and call request() method as many times as needed. The answer
# will be obtained through onAnswer() callback.
#
# It uses green threads (or coroutines) inside. See this link
# http://julia.readthedocs.org/en/latest/manual/control-flow/#man-tasks
# for more details regarding green threads. Comparing with
# server, it has only one place, where "magic" occures. It's
# request() method. It uses tasks for sending non blocking
# requests and obtaining answers (see @async macro in code).
# Every request creates one tasks

# See example below for details:
#
#     #
#     # This callback will be called as many times
#     # as many answers will be obtained from server.
#     #
#     function onAnswer(ans::Connection.Answer)
#       # do something with ans.data
#     end
#     #
#     # Creates the client and connects to server
#     #
#     connection = Client.create(ip"127.0.0.1", 2001)
#     #
#     # Starts to listen EVENT_AFTER_REQUEST event
#     #
#     Event.on(connection.observer, EVENT_AFTER_REQUEST, onAnswer)
#     #
#     # Makes a request to the server. An answer will
#     # be obtained in onAnswer() callback.
#     #
#     Client.request(connection, FUNCTION_ID, arg1, arg2)
#     #
#     # ...
#     #
#     Client.stop(conneciton)
#
# Events:
#     answer{Connection.Answer} Answer object with data
#           obtained from server. May be empty.
